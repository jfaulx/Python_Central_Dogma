# Coding the Central Dogma
This is a project that I did in my Foundations of Programming, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning class

Given a DNA fastq file, I filtered out low quality sequences, find the complemetary strand, convert the DNA sequence to an RNA sequence, translate the RNA sequence into a protein sequence and annotate the subsequent protein using minotaur. Each sequence ends up being around 10 amino acids long
